# Age-BMI Prediction

## Description

This research employs advanced machine learning methodologies to model and predict Body Mass Index (BMI) as a function of age. The project integrates a well-structured dataset (`age_bmi_prediction.csv`) and an extensively documented Jupyter Notebook (`age_bmi.ipynb`) that facilitates rigorous data preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive performance evaluation. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adnanvp/ML_PROJECT.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ML_PROJECT/ML_1
   ```

## Usage

1. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook age_bmi.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the notebook cells sequentially to preprocess the dataset, train the machine learning model, optimize hyperparameters, and evaluate predictive performance.

## Dataset

- **File:** `age_bmi_prediction.csv`
- **Description:** This dataset comprises age and corresponding BMI values, serving as the foundational data for training and validating predictive models.
