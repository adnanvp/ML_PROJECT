# **House Price Prediction**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset includes multiple attributes influencing house prices. A Jupyter Notebook is provided for data analysis and model training.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **`house_price.csv`** - Dataset containing house price information.
- **`house_price.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/adnanvp/ML_PROJECT.git
   cd cd ML_PROJECT/ML_2
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook house_price.ipynb
   ```

## 🚀 Usage Guide
- Load and explore the dataset.
