# 🌦 Weather Prediction

Welcome to the **Weather Prediction** project! This repository contains a machine learning model for weather classification and prediction based on historical weather data. 🌍⚡

## 🚀 Features
- **Weather Classification**: Classifies weather conditions based on historical data.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses supervised learning for accurate predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw weather data for training.
- **Visualization**: Provides insights through graphical representations.

## 💂‍♂️ Setup Instructions
To set up the project locally, follow these step-by-step instructions:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adnanvp/ML_PROJECT.git
cd ML_PROJECT/ML_4
```

### 2️⃣  Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook weather_prediction.ipynb
```

## 🎂 Project Structure
```
📺 Weather-Prediction
├── 🐝 Weather prediction.ipynb  # Jupyter Notebook for model development
├── 📃 weather_classification_data.csv  # Dataset used for training and testing

```

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset (`weather_classification_data.csv`) includes various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure to classify and predict weather conditions accurately.

## 📈 Model Training
The model is trained using machine learning algorithms in Python, leveraging libraries such as:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for visualization
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning tasks

## 🎯 Usage
- Modify the dataset if needed
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model
